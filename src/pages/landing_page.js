								details of a shoot to everyone’s account.

							<h3>Jobs Feed</h3>
							<p>
								When there’s work available we’ll see if
								you match up based on your yes/no list and
								personal characteristics. The posting will
								appear on your job feed and so you’ll always
								have a shoot waiting for you.
